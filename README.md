# FitIn
A "Linkedin-like" website to bring together people with interest in sports and physical activities in general.

## How to run this preject:

1. Setup mySQL. Pay attention to the host, user, password, and database informations;
2. Create a new schema. Create a 'users' table with two columns: email (varchar(30), PK) and password (varchar(20), NOT NULL);
3. Use ```PORT``` as ```localhost:3001```;
4. Install any required react dependencies;
5. Run the client using ```npm start```;
6. Run the server using ```node index.js``` or ```npm run dev```;

You can also test the user's CRUD using Postman.

Enjoy! :)
